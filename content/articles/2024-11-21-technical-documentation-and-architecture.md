I recently stumbled across a [University of Chicago Leadership Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) about the institution's writing program. I think the video is worth a watch -- there are many insights sprinkled throughout. But the thrust of the lecture amounts to: _you are not writing in a way that makes your readers care._ This is not your fault, you are very knowledgeable and your ideas are solid!... _but_ your coworkers, your product leaders, even your peers, they must work very hard to understand your vision. And I am sorry, but your vision may not be the reader's primary concern. To get your readers to understand and care about your vision, they need to understand how it relates to them.

At this point, we may be thinking: _isn't it the reader's **job** to care about these architecture docs?_

### Your readers need your help

Keep in mind that your readers are smart, competent professionals just like you. And just like you, they have to prioritize time based on how they think it will serve their role. This is true of your junior engineers, your senior engineers, your product managers, and your executives. I once tried waving around a big, detailed architecture document and asking for feedback. The response was: _"I'm not sure how this helps me do my job."_ Or, _"Hey yeah let's maybe talk about this later..." I still believe that the proposal I made would enable the organization to do more with less resources, but... what happened?

I had not see the video above, so at the time I did not know that my writing did not make my reader want to understand how the system would meet the business needs.

Referencing the lecture above, writing often reflects the writer's thinking. You, the writer, are an expert in the specific problem that your system addresses. As the expert in this area, you have a metric shit-ton of context, insight, and implicit assumptions. Usually, your reader does not share any of that with you. It seems challenging, but I try to step back and say, "I don't know about this system, and I don't know why I should care about its architecture."
