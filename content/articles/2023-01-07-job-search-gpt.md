# Save time on your job search with ChatGPT

> DISCLAIMER: Do not use this to lie on resumes or cover letters. ChatGPT is a language model, not a subject matter expert. It's a powerful tool that can act as a contextual templating engine, but not a replacement for human expertise. If you're using ChatGPT to generate job-application content, always carefully edit the outputs for accuracy and add your own voice.

You've heard of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT). This human-like text generation tool/chatbot can be used for pretty much anything; people are using it to write code, make (somewhat non-sequiteur) poetry, generate recipes... The list of possibilities is endless.

I started using ChatGPT recently, and it is already saving me hours and hours of work. I do not mind job hunting, on the whole. It's interesting to learn what commpanies in my region are up to, and I always learn a lot about different technologies when looking for a new job. The worst part, though, is writing cover letters. Using a template is too stale and does not capture the nuance of the position.

This is where ChatGPT comes in. Let me show you how.

Note that I am mostly sharing the prompts used during these chats; I am not providing every Chat GPT response because they are wordy and not directly related to this demonstration.

### Create our applicant

First, I create a professional description of myself. For the purposes of this article, we are going to use an invented persona named `Morgan Williams`. The name itself was suggested by ChatGPT as a generic, fictional, ungendered name! So, I prompted ChatGPT to come up with a profile for Morgan by giving it some prompts such as:
```
Morgan Williams is a software developer. They have 8 years of professional experience. They know Python, a little bash, and JavaScript.
```
```
Morgan Williams worked at a consulting company for the past two years
```
```
Before consulting, Morgan worked at a large corporation as a senior software engineer
```
... and so on. After I had built up some background information, I asked ChatGPT to generate a resume for Morgan.

```

Not bad, robot, not bad... So, now that we've built out some information on our candidate, let's get GPT to create a job description.


### Create the job description

I thought about just using a job description and obfuscating company data, but since we're buildking a fictional candidate, we might as well make a fictional company too!

```
Foozit is an online music platform. Foozit enables musicians to buy and sell used gear, helps match people with hard-to-find boutique instruments, and enables musicans to meet each other and form groups via its online platform. Foozit is a python and django shop using containerization to run on AWS Fargate.
```

```
Foozit is looking for an innovative senior software engineer to refactor and improve its existing systems as well as create new services
```

ChatGPT generates the following job description:

```

Good stuff, right!? Now, let's see what kind of cover letter ChatGPT can write for our hypothetical engineer, Morgan.

## Generate the cover letter

Giving ChatGPT the following prompt:
```
Write a cover letter for Morgan Williams to Foozit Senior Software
Engineer
```

We get the following cover letter.

```

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

```

This is pretty mind-blowing, but then we can even ask ChatGPT to edit/iterate on our cover letter. For example, if we tell it to add Django to Morgan's cover letter:
```
Morgan Williams is skilled with Django. Add that to the cover letter.
```

ChatGPT updates the 2nd paragraph! `...As a software developer with 8 years of professional experience, I have a strong background in Python, bash, and JavaScript, and am skilled in the Django web framework.`.

### A discussion on ethics

Personally, I see nothing disingenuous with using ChatGPT to reduce the legwork on applying for roles as long as I am not introducing false information. I can understand how ChatGPT can seem like "cheating" or threatening to existing professionals. Personally, I think tools like this are about to change how we work in a big way. It's important to look at this as a tool, not as a replacement.

ChatGPT can save hours of unspiring work, freeing my time and energy for things that matter more.
