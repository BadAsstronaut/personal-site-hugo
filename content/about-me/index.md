    I see my role as being a problem solver; frameworks and languages are simply tools for creating solutions.

Thanks for visiting. I am an experienced technologist and generalist with a focus on cloud technologies.

I enjoy collaborating with awesome teams to solve big problems. With a deep background in cloud infrastructure, identity and access management, and full stack development, I like jumping into whatever problem space needs work.

### Personal

I live in Broomfield, CO with my wife Markie, our children Ender and Milan, and our two dogs Jaymo and Onyx. When I'm not hacking away in an editor or command line, I enjoy cooking, playing guitar, and any excuse for getting outdoors.
