### Professional Background

We're just gonna skip over the whole education point and jump right into my career.

I worked as a technical writer for an oil and gas consultancy where we used a lot of data visualizations. After spending a few months clicking, dragging, and keyboard-shortcutting my way around Excel, I felt like the process could be automated. I picked up a programming book, __Excel 2010 Power Programming with VBA__ by [John Walkenbach](https://exceljet.net/people/john-walkenbach). I read most of that book page by page every evening, and then worked on automation scripts every day. Within a few weeks I had automated creating and captioning charts and graphs, adding annotations, exporting the graphs as images, and inserting them into PowerPoint!

I enjoyed automating my job so much that I realized that I wanted to solve these kinds of problems for a living. As the years went by I kept learning; soon I was writing C# .NET add-ins for Excel in order to get better performance and have more robust tooling for SOAP and REST integrations. I wrote Excel utilities to insert data into databases, tools for clients to batch-upload data into SaaS applications.

Around 2015, I finally got my first full time development job at Markit on Demand (now IHS Markit Digital). For the following 3 years I got to work with .NET MVC, node.js APIs, SQL Server React, Redux, and learn about all kinds of cool stuff like service discovery (consul.io), redis caching, and I enjoyed every minute of it!

In 2017, I took a role as a tech lead for Cognizant Accelerator in Boulder. The team culture at Cognizant was amazing, and the experience helped me learn a lot about agile and leadership. I got to work with technologies ranging from Docker to machine learning (TensorFlow and Keras), built a new Graph QL server with Python Flask, implemented a front end using React and Apollo client, and helped other teams create dockerized solutions. I had a particularly challenging time containerizing a legacy application running on Java!

While I enjoyed working at Cognizant, and the culture/people there were amazing, I felt like I wanted to work for a smaller organization and have a larger individual impact. I took a role at a very small start up. I did not work for them for very long, but I got to learn a ton of AWS in those 6 months. We migrated a legacy application from Linode to AWS by containerizing the full stack, we experimented with CI CD using Terraform and Concourse CI (Too complicated for what we were trying to do), scripted secure secret management using Hashicorpt Vault, and scaffolded a new application using .NET Core and React/Redux. I didn't work there long, but I learned a lot in a very short time. 

Through all of this, I have gained a decent understanding of Linux/UNIX systems, bash scripting, and solid problem solving methodologies. I see my role as solving problems; frameworks, languages, operating systems, etc., are all simply tools to solve the problems my customers or employers face.

Right now, I am looking for my next great role. I love learning new technologies, and I relish the opportunity to wear a bunch of different hats. I enjoy dev-ops and would like to learn a lot more. 

### Personal

I live in Broomfield, CO with my wife Markie, our children Ender and Milan, and our two dogs Jaymo and Onyx. When I'm not hacking away in an editor or command line, I enjoy cooking, playing guitar, getting outdoors, and the occasional video game.
